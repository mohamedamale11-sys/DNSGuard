# Methodology (template)

This is where you upgrade the project into a mini‑study for scholarship reviewers.

Recommended:
1) Choose a dataset (e.g., 200 domains): top sites, university domains, your own sample.
2) Run `dnsguard scan` for each domain and store JSON outputs.
3) Aggregate results: % with DMARC, % with strict SPF, % with CAA, % with DNSSEC signals.
4) Discuss limitations and ethical handling (passive checks only).
